# QualityControl
Quality control for TQS data

This code performs a quality-control check on output from [Skyline] ( https://skyline.gs.washington.edu/labkey/project/home/software/Skyline/begin.view) .  You will also need "Master list" that notes which transition should be used for quantification.  

Please cite the following paper when using this code:

# Setup
Run the samples should be run in the following manner for the quality control and [B-MIS normalization] (https://github.com/IngallsLabUW/B-MIS-normalization):

* Standards run (all mixed) at least once at the beginning and end of the run, labeled:  Date_Std_AdditionalID (e.g. 161018_Std_FirstStandardinH20)
* Standards run (in representative matrix, all mixed) at least once the beginning and end of the run, labeled Date_Std_AdditionalID (e.g. 161018_Std_FirstStandardinMatrix)
*  Blanks run (preferably method/filter blanks) at least once labeled: Date_Blk_AdditionalID (e.g. 161018_Blk_FirstBlank)
* A pooled sample run at least three times throughout the run, labeled: Date_Poo_AdditionalID_Rep (e.g. 161018_Poo_PooledSample_1)
* Samples, labeled: Date_Smp_AdditionalID_Rep (e.g. 161018_Std_FirstSample_BioRep1)

# Software
This code is written in R .

It requires the following packages available on CRAN: 
* plyr
* reshape2

## Example to test
Input files for testing code are: 
*  HILIC_MasterList_Example.csv
* ExampleSkylineOutput.csv

Output should match the file
 *  QC_outputExampleSkylineOutput.csv
